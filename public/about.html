<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my about me page! I'm Vivek Kewalramani, a 20-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Residing in the lively city of Gurgaon, Haryana, I have a deep passion for technology and its limitless possibilities. 
  However, I also believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle. When I'm not engrossed in coding or staying up to date with the latest advancements, you can find me indulging in my other interests. 
  I am an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying games like football, cricket, and badminton.

<p>Traveling is another passion of mine, as I love exploring new places, capturing moments through photography, and embracing diverse cultures.
 Additionally, I find solace in hitting the open road, driving and embarking on spontaneous road trips. With a firm belief in personal growth and lifelong learning, I also enjoy reading books, exploring music, and expanding my knowledge beyond the boundaries of technology.
 I invite you to join me on this exciting journey of a well-rounded lifestyle, fueled by a love for sports, travel, and the joy of exploration.</p>
